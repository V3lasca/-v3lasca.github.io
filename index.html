					My journey to the field of cybersecurity has 
					been an interesting experience. Before I went into the
					IT industry, I was interested in animation because I 
					enjoyed watching cartoons on Cartoon Network. So I wanted
					to be an animator.
				</p>
				<p>
					I attended to a school to get a degree
					in animation, but due to the lack of guidance
					I could not progress any further in the field 
					that I wanted to do. On the school's website I saw
					an ad for their cybersecurity bootcamp, so I decided
					to try it out. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I enjoyed the entirety of the course. 
					The program taught me the basic fundamentals of
					each aspects in cybersecurity like network security, programming,
					digital forensics, and ethical hacking. After finishing the program 
					I decided that I wanted to be a

						penetration tester
					</a>
					<span class="period-spacing">.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					I chose this career because of an episode I watched called 
					<a class="links" target="_blank" href="https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/101/">
						LOTER√çA
					</a>
					<span class="period-spacing">.</span>
					A US consultant went to Puerto Rico to investigate
					the loss of lottery funds and found evidence that a cartel was 
					stealing money from the lottery and laundering it.
					How he was able to achieve his goals was pretty interesting.
				</p>
				<p>
					Today, I still enjoy cybersecurity, but sometimes
					it can be overwhelming with new information popping 
					up every second. So I take a break from it and 
					enjoy my favorite hobbies; writing and parkour.
